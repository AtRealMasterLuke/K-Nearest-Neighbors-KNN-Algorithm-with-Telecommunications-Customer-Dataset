    1. "n_neighbors": This key corresponds to the number of neighbors to consider for classification. The value np.arange(1, 50) generates an array of integers from 1 to 49. This means the model will try each of these values to find the optimal number of neighbors.
    2. 
"metric": This key specifies the distance metric to use for calculating the distance between points. The possible values are:        

"minkowski": A generalization of the Euclidean and Manhattan distanc        es.
"euclidean": The straight-line distance between two poi        nts.
"manhattan": The sum of the absolute differences of their coordinates (also known as L1 dist

    3. nce).
"weights": This key determines how the influence of each neighbor is weighted. The possible valu

        "uniform": All neighbors have equal weight.        
"distance": Closer neighbors have a greater influence on the prediction than farther ones.sWe have seen that GridSearch has indeed increased the accuracy score to 35% from 33.5% our KNN model.
