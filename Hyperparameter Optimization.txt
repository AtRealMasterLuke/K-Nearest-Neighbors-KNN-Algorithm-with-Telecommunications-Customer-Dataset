knn_params = {"n_neighbors" : np.arange(1,50),
             "metric" : ["minkowski", "euclidean", "manhattan"],
             "weights": ["uniform", "distance"]}
    1. "n_neighbors": This key corresponds to the number of neighbors to consider for classification. The value np.arange(1, 50) generates an array of integers from 1 to 49. This means the model will try each of these values to find the optimal number of neighbors.
    
    2."metric": This key specifies the distance metric to use for calculating the distance between points. The possible values are:        

                "minkowski": A generalization of the Euclidean and Manhattan distances.
                "euclidean": The straight-line distance between two points.
                "manhattan": The sum of the absolute differences of their coordinates (also known as L1 distance).

    3."weights": This key determines how the influence of each neighbor is weighted. The possible values are:

                "uniform": All neighbors have equal weight.
                "distance": Closer neighbors have a greater influence on the prediction than farther ones.

We have seen that GridSearch has indeed increased the accuracy score to 35% from 33.5% our KNN model.
